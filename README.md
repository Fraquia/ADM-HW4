In this repository you can find four python's files where developed from scratch some popular algorithms: 

1. **hashing_lib.py** : where we developed an hashing functions 
2. **sorting_lib.py** : where we developed sorting algorithms for number and letters
3. **clustering_lib.py** : where we developed K-means clustering algorithm
4. **map_reduce_lib.py** : where we developed map reduce algorithm
